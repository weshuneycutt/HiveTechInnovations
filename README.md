# HiveTechInnovations
HiveTech Innovations is a hypothetical company created for BINF 5900 Principals of Team Science. Here we had to build a hypothetical biotech company through the use of research, reporting, and presentations. 
HiveTech Innovations focuses on "Building a Better Bee". We plan to help our nature's number 1 polinator, the Honeybee, to live longer by selectively breeding with select other bees to create a more resistant, hardier bee. 

This project was a collaborative assignment with Wes Huneycutt as CEO, Sabrina Pinard as CTO, and Catherine Cheedle as CFO. 
Course Professor and Business Advisor: Dr. Richard Allen White III
